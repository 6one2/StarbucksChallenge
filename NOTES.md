# __Starbuck's Capstone Challenge__

Instructions for the project can be found in the Starbucks Project Workspace.

## __Dataset overview__
The program used to create the data simulates how people make purchasing decisions and how those decisions are influenced by promotional offers.

Each person in the simulation has some hidden traits that influence their purchasing patterns and are associated with their observable traits. People produce various events, including receiving offers, opening offers, and making purchases.

As a simplification, there are no explicit products to track. Only the amounts of each transaction or offer are recorded.

There are three types of offers that can be sent:
 1. __buy-one-get-one (BOGO)__: In a BOGO offer, a user needs to spend a certain amount to get a reward equal to that threshold amount
 2. __discount__: In a discount, a user gains a reward equal to a fraction of the amount spent.
 3. __informational__: In an informational offer, there is no reward, but neither is there a requisite amount that the user is expected to spend.

Offers can be delivered via multiple channels. The basic task is to use the data to identify which groups of people are most responsive to each type of offer, and how best to present each type of offer.

# __Build Your Data Science Project__

In this capstone project, you will leverage what youâ€™ve learned throughout the program to build a data science project of your choosing. Your project deliverables are:

1. __A Github repository of your work.__
2. __A blog (or other medium for a write-up) post written for a technical audience.__

__or__

2. __A deployed web application powered by data.__

You'll follow the steps of the data science process that we've discussed:

- You will first define the problem you want to solve and investigate potential solutions.
- Next, you will analyze the problem through visualizations and data exploration to have a better understanding of what algorithms and features are appropriate for solving it.
- You will then implement the algorithms and metrics of your choice, documenting the preprocessing, refinement, and post-processing steps along the way.
- Afterwards, you will collect results about your findings, visualize significant quantities, validate/justify your results, and make any concluding remarks about whether your implementation adequately solves the problem.
- Finally, you will construct a blog post (or other medium for a write-up) to document all of the steps from start to finish of your project, or deploy your results into a web application.

## __Setting Yourself Apart__

An important part of landing a job or advancing your career as a data scientist is setting yourself apart through impressive data science projects. By now, you've completed several guided projects, and now's your chance to show off your skills and creativity. You'll receive a review of your project with feedback from a Udacity mentor, and they will focus on how your project demonstrates your skills as a well-rounded data scientist.

This project is designed to prepare you for delivering a polished, end-to-end solution report of a real-world problem in a field of interest. When developing new technology, or deriving adaptations of previous technology, properly documenting your process is critical for both validating and replicating your results.

## __Things you will learn by completing this project:__

- How to research and investigate a real-world problem of interest.
- How to accurately apply specific data science algorithms and techniques.
- How to properly analyze and visualize your data and results for validity.
- How to document and write a report of your work.

### Introduction

This data set contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks.

Not all users receive the same offer, and that is the challenge to solve with this data set.

Your task is to combine transaction, demographic and offer data to determine which demographic groups respond best to which offer type. This data set is a simplified version of the real Starbucks app because the underlying simulator only has one product whereas Starbucks actually sells dozens of products.

Every offer has a validity period before the offer expires. As an example, a BOGO offer might be valid for only 5 days. You'll see in the data set that informational offers have a validity period even though these ads are merely providing information about a product; for example, if an informational offer has 7 days of validity, you can assume the customer is feeling the influence of the offer for 7 days after receiving the advertisement.

You'll be given transactional data showing user purchases made on the app including the timestamp of purchase and the amount of money spent on a purchase. This transactional data also has a record for each offer that a user receives as well as a record for when a user actually views the offer. There are also records for when a user completes an offer.

Keep in mind as well that someone using the app might make a purchase through the app without having received an offer or seen an offer.

### Example

To give an example, a user could receive a discount offer buy 10 dollars get 2 off on Monday. The offer is valid for 10 days from receipt. If the customer accumulates at least 10 dollars in purchases during the validity period, the customer completes the offer.

However, there are a few things to watch out for in this data set. Customers do not opt into the offers that they receive; in other words, a user can receive an offer, never actually view the offer, and still complete the offer. For example, a user might receive the "buy 10 dollars get 2 dollars off offer", but the user never opens the offer during the 10 day validity period. The customer spends 15 dollars during those ten days. There will be an offer completion record in the data set; however, the customer was not influenced by the offer because the customer never viewed the offer.

### Cleaning

This makes data cleaning especially important and tricky.

You'll also want to take into account that some demographic groups will make purchases even if they don't receive an offer. From a business perspective, if a customer is going to make a 10 dollar purchase without an offer anyway, you wouldn't want to send a buy 10 dollars get 2 dollars off offer. You'll want to try to assess what a certain demographic group will buy when not receiving any offers.

### Final Advice

Because this is a capstone project, you are free to analyze the data any way you see fit. For example, you could build a machine learning model that predicts how much someone will spend based on demographics and offer type. Or you could build a model that predicts whether or not someone will respond to an offer. Or, you don't need to build a machine learning model at all. You could develop a set of heuristics that determine what offer you should send to each customer (i.e., 75 percent of women customers who were 35 years old responded to offer A vs 40 percent from the same demographic to offer B, so send offer A).
